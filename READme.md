### PASSWORD LOCKER
This in an application that is used to store login credentials for various users in a centralized location

### By Ephraim Kamau

### Description
On average, a person has various accounts that he/she is signed into. It becomes difficult to always remember the login credentials and even create new ones since they are quite many. The login credentials include usernames, passwords and emails.
This application therefore helps the users to store all their login credentials in a single location. Users can then log in to the application to access their credentials.
Users can save the login credentials, delete the unnecessary ones and search for the login credentials within the application.

### Setup Instructions
<ul>
<li>The user opens the terminal and navigates to where the application is stored.</li>
<li>The user then runs this command: `python3.6 run.py`.</li>
<li>They receive a welcome message prompting them to enter their name.</li>
<li>They enter their name and a list of commands appears.</li>
<li>The user can then use the commands to perform various actions. The actions include creating new users, displaying the users, creating new credentials, finding credentials, deleting credentials and displaying credentials.</li>
<li>After the user has finished using the application, he/she can exit by typing `ex`.</li>
</ul>

### Technologies Used
